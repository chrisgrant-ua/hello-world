# hello-world
This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow.
My name is Chris Grant and I am a data analyst and junior programmer using python. I create data pipelines and ETL processes using cloud database APIs. 
I live in NYC and moved here with my wife shortly after we were married 2.5 years ago.
